1. This is the backend code for my new To do List app. This app not only for to do list but its gonna have
real time weather feature and user authentication feature.
2. Also iam gonna include AI feautre later on once after iam done with all other things.
3. Its gonna improve the description and give ideas this can be achived by using openAI's API.
4. I am using JWT for authentication.
5. Iam not 100% sure about live production i mean deploymen. Might do it later.
If iam gonna deploy i will be using Railway it needs this to be dockerized thats why later!!!!.


Lets see iam thinking to complete this by this month June all the features including AI part. After that iam moving towards frontend (React).
